# 🔍 SVM Classification with Scikit-learn (Linear & Non-Linear)

This project demonstrates how to use **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for both **linear** and **non-linear** binary classification using Scikit-learn in Google Colab.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Use **SVM** with both **Linear** and **RBF kernels**
- Visualize decision boundaries in 2D
- Evaluate model performance

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📚 Steps Followed

1. **Load 2D dataset** using `make_moons` from sklearn
2. **Split** data into training and testing sets
3. **Scale** features using `StandardScaler`
4. **Train** SVM with:
   - Linear Kernel
   - RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel
5. **Visualize** decision boundaries using `matplotlib`
6. **Evaluate** model accuracy on test data

---

## 📈 Results

- Compared performance between linear and non-linear SVMs
- Visualized how decision boundaries differ
- Showed RBF is better for non-linear patterns

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in **Google Colab**
2. Run each cell step by step
3. Observe decision boundaries and accuracy

> ✅ No installation required if running in Google Colab.

---

## 📎 Example Output

- SVM with Linear Kernel – straight decision boundary
- SVM with RBF Kernel – curved boundary that better fits complex data
